**Course Notes: Design and Analysis of Algorithms**

**Module 1: Design Paradigms**

### Overview and Importance

The design of algorithms is a crucial step in solving real-world problems efficiently. This module introduces two fundamental algorithm design paradigms: Greedy and Divide-and-Conquer techniques.

### Stages of Algorithm Development:

1. **Describing the Problem**: Identify the problem to be solved and describe it clearly.
2. **Identifying Suitable Technique**: Choose an appropriate algorithm design paradigm (Greedy or Divide-and-Conquer) for solving the problem.
3. **Designing the Algorithm**: Develop a high-level description of the algorithm, breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems.
4. **Deriving Time Complexity**: Analyze the time complexity of the algorithm using mathematical tools.
5. **Proof of Correctness**: Verify the correctness of the algorithm through rigorous proof and testing.

### Greedy Techniques:

1. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: A classic example of a greedy algorithm, where items with fractional weights are packed into a knapsack to maximize the total value.
2. **Huffman Coding**: A greedy algorithm for compressing data by assigning variable-length codes to symbols based on their frequency.

### Divide-and-Conquer Techniques:

1. **Maximum Subarray**: Find the maximum contiguous subarray of an array using the divide-and-conquer approach.
2. **Karatsuba Faster Integer Multiplication Algorithm**: A fast multiplication algorithm that takes advantage of the divide-and-conquer principle.

**Module 2: Design Paradigms (continued)**

### Dynamic Programming:

1. **Assembly Line Scheduling**: Schedule tasks on an assembly line to minimize the total processing time using dynamic programming.
2. **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: Use dynamic programming to find the most efficient way to multiply a sequence of matrices.
3. **Longest Common Subsequence**: Find the longest common subsequence between two sequences using dynamic programming.

### Backtracking:

1. **N-Queens Problem**: Solve the classic N-queens problem, where N queens are placed on an NxN chessboard such that no queen attacks another.
2. **Subset Sum**: Use backtracking to find a subset of integers that sums up to a given target value.
3. **Graph Coloring**: Color the vertices of a graph using backtracking such that adjacent vertices have different colors.

### Branch & Bound:

1. **Job Selection Problem**: Solve a job selection problem using branch and bound, where jobs are assigned to machines to minimize the total processing time.
2. **0-1 Knapsack Problem**: Use branch and bound to solve the 0-1 knapsack problem, where items with weights and values must be packed into a knapsack.

**Module 3: String Matching Algorithms**

### Naive String-Matching Algorithm:

A simple algorithm for finding patterns in strings by comparing each character in the pattern with the corresponding characters in the text.

### KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm:

An efficient algorithm for string matching that uses a pre-processing step to construct a lookup table for faster pattern searching.

### Rabin-Karp Algorithm:

A fast algorithm for string matching that uses a rolling hash function and a sliding window approach to find patterns in strings.

**Module 4: Algorithms**

### Pair Shortest Path:

1. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
2. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph.

### Network Flows:

1. **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm**: Solve maximum flow problems in networks using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.
2. **Edmonds-Karp Algorithm**: Use the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to solve maximum flow problems in networks.
3. **Push-Relabel Algorithm**: Apply the push-relabel algorithm to solve maximum flow problems in networks.

**Module 5: Geometric Algorithms**

### Line Segments:

1. **Properties**: Discuss properties of line segments, such as intersection and sweeping lines.
2. **Convex Hull Finding Algorithms**: Use algorithms like Graham's Scan and Jarvis March to find the convex hull of a set of points.

**Module 6-8: Randomized Algorithms, Complexity Theory, and Approximation**

These modules will be covered in subsequent notes.
