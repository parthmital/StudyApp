This module introduces two fundamental algorithm design paradigms: Greedy and Divide-and-Conquer techniques.\n### Stages of Algorithm Development:\n1. **Describing the Problem**: Identify the problem to be solved and describe it clearly. 2. **Identifying Suitable Technique**: Choose an appropriate algorithm design paradigm (Greedy or Divide-and-Conquer) for solving the problem. 3. **Designing the Algorithm**: Develop a high-level description of the algorithm, breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems. 4. **Deriving Time Complexity**: Analyze the time complexity of the algorithm using mathematical tools. 5. **Proof of Correctness**: Verify the correctness of the algorithm through rigorous proof and testing.\n### Greedy Techniques:\n1. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: A classic example of a greedy algorithm, where items with fractional weights are packed into a knapsack to maximize the total value. 2. **Huffman Coding**: A greedy algorithm for compressing data by assigning variable-length codes to symbols based on their frequency.\n### Divide-and-Conquer Techniques:\n1. **Maximum Subarray**: Find the maximum contiguous subarray of an array using the divide-and-conquer approach. 2. **Karatsuba Faster Integer Multiplication Algorithm**: A fast multiplication algorithm that takes advantage of the divide-and-conquer principle.\n**Module 2: Design Paradigms (continued)**\n### Dynamic Programming:\n1. **Assembly Line Scheduling**: Schedule tasks on an assembly line to minimize the total processing time using dynamic programming. 2. **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: Use dynamic programming to find the most efficient way to multiply a sequence of matrices. 3. **Longest Common Subsequence**: Find the longest common subsequence between two sequences using dynamic programming.\n### Backtracking:\n1. **N-Queens Problem**: Solve the classic N-queens problem, where N queens are placed on an NxN chessboard such that no queen attacks another. 2. **Subset Sum**: Use backtracking to find a subset of integers that sums up to a given target value. 3. **Graph Coloring**: Color the vertices of a graph using backtracking such that adjacent vertices have different colors.\n### Branch & Bound:\n1. **Job Selection Problem**: Solve a job selection problem using branch and bound, where jobs are assigned to machines to minimize the total processing time. 2. **0-1 Knapsack Problem**: Use branch and bound to solve the 0-1 knapsack problem, where items with weights and values must be packed into a knapsack.\n**Module 3: String Matching Algorithms**\n### Naive String-Matching Algorithm:\nA simple algorithm for finding patterns in strings by comparing each character in the pattern with the corresponding characters in the text.\n### KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm:\nAn efficient algorithm for string matching that uses a pre-processing step to construct a lookup table for faster pattern searching.\n### Rabin-Karp Algorithm:\nA fast algorithm for string matching that uses a rolling hash function and a sliding window approach to find patterns in strings.\n**Module 4: Algorithms**\n### Pair Shortest Path:\n1. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph using the Bellman-Ford algorithm. 2. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest path between all pairs of nodes in a weighted graph.\n### Network Flows:\n1. **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm**: Solve maximum flow problems in networks using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. 2. **Edmonds-Karp Algorithm**: Use the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to solve maximum flow problems in networks. 3. **Push-Relabel Algorithm**: Apply the push-relabel algorithm to solve maximum flow problems in networks.\n**Module 5: Geometric Algorithms**\n### Line Segments:\n1. **Properties**: Discuss properties of line segments, such as intersection and sweeping lines. 2. **Convex Hull Finding Algorithms**: Use algorithms like Graham's Scan and Jarvis March to find the convex hull of a set of points.\n**Module 6-8: Randomized Algorithms, Complexity Theory, and Approximation**\nThese modules will be covered in subsequent notes.\n**References:**\n1. **Textbook:** Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H.
